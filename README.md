TODO:
-----
[1] more robust qrs detector (finished)

[2] feature engineering (deprecated)

[3] deep learning model structure design (ongoing)

[4] use SNR to deal with (eliminate?) too noisy segments?

[5] etc....

further updates will be done in [torch_ecg](https://github.com/wenh06/torch_ecg/tree/master/torch_ecg/train/train_crnn_cpsc2020), instead of this repository
